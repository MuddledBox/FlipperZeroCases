Here's some really early 3d printable flipper cases! 

## Hard Cases (PLA, ABS, PETG, etc.)

- BasicFlipperCoverV4.STL is a basic hard cover that covered GPIO, USB-C, and SD slot. Print in rigid plastic (PLA, ABS, etc.) Tested and working, but a maybe too easy to take off... Use a rubber band to secure! 
- BasicFlipperCoverV5EasyPrint.STL is an improvement of the above but features a rubber band slot and easier printing angles (if you choose not to use supports).

## Soft Cases (TPU or other flexible filament)

- ThiccBoi9000FlipperCaseV2.STL is a flexible cover that is meant to be printed in TPU or similar filament. Tested and working, but TPU is a not so fun material to print with. 

SUPPORTS DURING PRINTING RECOMMENDED!
