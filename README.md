Here's some really early 3d printable flipper cases! 

- BasicFlipperCoverV4.STL is a basic hard cover that covered GPIO, USB-C, and SD slot. Print in rigid plastic (PLA, ABS, etc.) Tested and working, but a maybe too easy to take off... 
- ThiccBoi9000FlipperCaseV1C.STL is a flexible cover that is meant to be printed in TPU or similar filament. UNTESTED!
